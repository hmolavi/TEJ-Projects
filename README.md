# TEJ-Projects
The two major projects completed in TEJ class

## Firefighter Robot
An autonomous robot which searches, locates and blows out a flame. 
Uses wall tracking strategy to find the flame, and uses the blower fan to put the flame out all handled by the BASIC software
All of the PCB are custome built and components are PTH soldered 

Main Components Used:
- PIC16F887 Microchip as the main controller
- L293D as the motor driver
- 2 distance sensors
- 2 IR sensors, one for detecting flame and one for line follower
- 2 BO Motors
- 16Ã—2 Character LCD Module
- 12V Blower fan

## LED Cube 
A 4x4x4 LED cube, 
Used PWM technique in BASIC to display a set of complex animations
Designed and built on a custom PCB mounted to a CNC'd board
